Instructions:
1. You have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word.
2. Each letter of the word is represented by a cell in the table.
3. After each attempt, the table will show your progress:
    - \033[92mGreen\033[0m cell indicates a correct letter in the correct position.
    - \033[93mYellow\033[0m cell indicates a correct letter in the wrong position.
    - \033[91mRed\033[0m cell indicates an incorrect letter.
5. Your goal is to guess the hidden word correctly within the given attempts.

Let's get started!"""
